# Gris and Grau Extra Stages

This plugin allows for the CS:GO extra stages to be played on CSS. A plugin is needed for precaching sounds in CSS unlike in CS:GO, and to add the music files to the file downloads table for players.

> [!WARNING]
> Gris RTV4 has a **VERY HIGH CHANCE OF CRASHING**. Consider playing at your own risk.
